          Srinivasa Ramanujan was a largely self-taught pure mathematician.
          Hindered by poverty and ill-health, his highly original work has
          considerably enriched number theory. More recently his discoveries
          have been applied to physics, where his theta function lies at the
          heart of string theory.

          <p>
            Srinivasa Ramanujan was born on December 22, 1887 in the town of
            Erode, in Tamil Nadu, in the south east of India. His father was K.
            Srinivasa Iyengar, an accounting clerk for a clothing merchant. His
            mother was Komalatammal, who earned a small amount of money each
            month as a singer at the local temple.
          </p>
          <p>
            His family were Brahmins, the Hindu caste of priests and scholars.
            His mother ensured the boy was in tune with Brahmin traditions and
            culture. Although his family were high caste, they were very poor.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ramanujan’s parents moved around a lot, and he attended a variety of
            different elementary schools

          <h3 class="fontLarge">Ramanujan at Cambridge</h3>
          <p>
            Ramanujan arrived in Cambridge in April 1914, three months before
            the outbreak of World War 1. Within days he had begun work with
            Hardy and Littlewood. Two years later, he was awarded the equivalent
            of a Ph.D. for his work a mere formality.
          </p>

          <p>
            Srinivasa Ramanujan after his Cambridge degree was awarded in March
            1916.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ramanujan’s prodigious mathematical output amazed Hardy and
            Littlewood.
          </p>

          <p>
            The notebooks he brought from India were filled with thousands of
            identities, equations, and theorems he discovered for himself in the
            years 1903-1914.

          <h3 class="fontLarge">Some Personal Details and the End</h3>
          <p>
            In July 1909, Ramanujan married S. Janaki Ammal, who was then just
            10 years old. The marriage had been arranged by Ramanujan’s mother.
            The couple began sharing a home in 1912.
          </p>
          <p>
            When Ramanujan left to study at the University of Cambridge, his
            wife moved in with Ramanujan’s parents. Ramanujan’s scholarship was
            sufficient for his needs in Cambridge and the family’s needs in
            Kumbakonam.
          </p>

          <p>
            For his first three years in Cambridge, Ramanujan was very happy.
            His health, however, had always been rather poor. The winter weather
            in England, much colder than anything he had ever imagined, made him
            ill for a time.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 1917, he was diagnosed with tuberculosis and worryingly low
            vitamin levels. He spent months being cared for in sanitariums and
            nursing homes.
          </p>

          <p>
            In February 1919, his health seemed to have recovered sufficiently
            for him to return to India, but sadly he lived for only one more
            year.
          </p>

          <p>
            Srinivasa Ramanujan died aged 32 in Madras on April 26, 1920. His
            death was most likely caused by hepatic amoebiasis caused by liver
            parasites common in Madras. His body was cremated.
          </p>

          <p>
            Sadly, some of Ramanujan’s Brahmin relatives refused to attend his
            funeral because he had traveled overseas.
